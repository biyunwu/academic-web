        bookIntroduction: [
            `Are there Buddhist conceptions of the unconscious? If so, are they more Freudian, Jungian, or something else? If not, can Buddhist conceptions be reconciled with the Freudian, Jungian, or other models? These are some of the questions that have motivated modern scholarship to approach *ālayavijñāna*, the storehouse consciousness, formulated in Yogācāra Buddhism as a subliminal reservoir of tendencies, habits, and future possibilities.`,
            `Tao Jiang argues convincingly that such questions are inherently problematic because they frame their interpretations of the Buddhist notion largely in terms of responses to modern psychology. He proposes that, if we are to understand *ālayavijñāna* properly and compare it with the unconscious responsibly, we need to change the way the questions are posed so that *ālayavijñāna* and the unconscious can first be understood within their own contexts and then recontextualized within a dialogical setting. In so doing, certain paradigmatic assumptions embedded in the original frameworks of Buddhist and modern psychological theories are exposed. Jiang brings together Xuan Zang’s *ālayavijñāna* and Freud’s and Jung’s unconscious to focus on what the differences are in the thematic concerns of the three theories, why such differences exist in terms of their objectives, and how their methods of theorization contribute to these differences.`,
            `Contexts and Dialogue puts forth a fascinating, erudite, and carefully argued presentation of the subliminal mind. It proposes a new paradigm in comparative philosophy that examines the what, why, and how in navigating the similarities and differences of philosophical systems through contextualization and recontextualization.`

                review: `“The wonderful sense of conclusion that Jiang brings to the reader is conveyed in the idea that there is much to be learned through interdisciplinary discussion. Jiang emphasizes that this discussion cannot take place at a shallow level, as very little new knowledge can be gained thereby. The point is made that we must learn to engage with different disciplines through what he calls ‘‘context and dialogue.’’ Overall, Jiang’s main argument for the importance of creating a new methodology for cross-disciplinary research in this way is presented very successfully.”`,

One leaves this book convinced that synthetic dialogue between Buddhism and modern psychology is possible, but that it will falter without adequate analysis of the paradigmatic differences that shape their respective projects.”`,

        bookIntroduction: [
            `Although Freud makes only occasional, brief references to China and Chinese culture in his works, for almost a hundred years many leading Chinese intellectuals have studied and appropriated various Freudian theories. However, whilst some features of Freud’s views have been warmly embraced from the start and appreciated for their various explanatory and therapeutic values, other aspects have been vigorously criticized as implausible or inapplicable to the Chinese context.`,
            `This book explores the history, reception, and use of Freud and his theories in China, and makes an original and substantial contribution to our understanding of the Chinese people and their culture as well as to our appreciation of western attempts to understand the people and culture of China. The essays are organised around three key areas of research. First, it examines the historical background concerning the China-Freud connection in the 20th century, before going on to use reconstructed Freudian theories in order to provide a modernist critique of Chinese culture. Finally, the book deploys traditional Chinese thought in order to challenge various aspects of the Freudian project. Both Freudianism’s universal appeal and its cultural particularity are in full display throughout the book. At the same time, the allure of Chinese cultural and literary expressions, both in terms of their commonality with other cultures and their distinctive characteristics, are also scrutinized.`,
            `This collection of essays will be welcomed by those interested in early modern and contemporary China, as well as the work and influence of Freud. It will also be of great interest to students and scholars of psychology, psychoanalysis, literature, philosophy, religion, and cultural studies more generally.`

        name: 'Tao Jiang',
        details: [
            `Tao JIANG grew up in the ancient city of [Chengdu](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/06/t-magazine/chengdu-china-travel-guide.html) in China’s southwest, “where the pace is slow, the food is spicy and there’s always time for a good gossip over a cup of tea.” When he was a boy, Jiang often dreamt of an adventurous life in a faraway place, which probably explains why he came all the way to America to pursue his dream. He is associate professor in the [Department of Religion](http://religion.rutgers.edu/tao-jiang) and an associate member of the graduate faculty in the Department of Philosophy at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey in New Brunswick, US. He is director of the multidisciplinary [Rutgers Center for Chinese Studies](https://rccs.rutgers.edu).`,
            `Jiang is a scholar of classical Chinese philosophy, Mahāyāna Buddhist philosophy, and comparative philosophy. Although America is far enough from China, an academic life devoted to philosophical inquiry does not sound like much of an adventure. Except it *is* an adventure: a genuine philosophical inquiry is an adventure of the mind in which that very inquisitive mind is its own limit. Jiang’s approach to philosophy is to treat it as a way to study particular forms of intellectual and moral culture and the people who produce it.`,
            `Jiang is the author of *Contexts and Dialogue: Yogācāra Buddhism and Modern Psychology on the Subliminal Mind* and the co-editor of *The Reception and Rendition of Freud in China: China’s Freudian Slip*. His articles have appeared in leading Asian and comparative philosophy journals and several major anthologies. Currently he is completing a monograph on classical Chinese philosophy. Jiang co-directs the Rutgers Workshop on Chinese Philosophy and co-chairs the Neo-Confucian Studies Seminar at Columbia University. He is currently serving in the program committee of the American Academy of Religion.`,
            `Jiang is happily married. He and his spouse enjoy hanging out in coffee shops, museums, parks, and watching movies. They play tennis from time to time. Jiang supports all effort dedicated to the saving of the world's wildlife. These amazing videos [“Hungry polar bear surprises a seal”] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mgnf6t9VEc), [“Elephant Calf Starves To Death Due To Drought”] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqeC6XB94zs) from the [BBC Earth series] (https://www.facebook.com/bbcearth) have opened up his eyes to the beauty, intelligence and misery of animal lives in the wilderness.
